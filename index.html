<p>We want to solve various problems encountered by plant collectors, botanists, and gardeners. Searching correct information about botany has been a pain for a long time because of all those false information on the internet and the difficulty to understand original research publications from academic journal. Here, we present a chatbot that utilize the open data certified by the professionals and experts from the public sectors to answer questions from general public who are interested in botany.</p>

<p>We built a chatbot that answer questions from general public who are interested in botany. We use Dialogflow to solve natural language processing and connect to the instant messaging platform LINE. The business logic were fulfilled through custom python scripts that query open data API.</p>
